# Unit Converter

A multiplatform Flutter app that converts units in 8 categories (length, area, volume, mass, time, digital storage,
energy, currency). The app was built with guidance from Udacity helper code. 
<br /><br />
The Dart source code can be found in the `lib` folder.

Below are screenshots that showcase the user interface and demonstrate the functionality of the app. <br /><br />
